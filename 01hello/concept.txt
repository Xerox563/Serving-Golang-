01hello Module Concepts
====================

Key Concepts:
1. Basic Go Program Structure
   - package declaration (package main)
   - import statements
   - main function as entry point

2. Important Elements Used:
   - fmt package for basic I/O
   - Println function for console output
   - Function declaration syntax
   - Package-level scope

3. Syntax Introduction:
   - Go's basic syntax for function declaration
   - Package import syntax
   - String literal usage

This module serves as the introduction to Go programming, demonstrating the minimal structure required for a working Go program.


// fmt is a toolbox in go for handling text input and output.

** Behind the Scenes?

Go compiler reads your file.
Sees package main → knows it must make a runnable program.
Loads the fmt package.
Finds the main() function → this is the entry point.
Execution starts in main().
It runs fmt.Println("Hello, World!").
The console prints exactly what’s inside the quotes (plus a new line).

// printf 
-> gives you fine control over how the output looks.
-> You must provide a format string with special placeholders (like %s, %d, %f).
// prinln 
-> prints your text and automatically adds a new line at the end .
