Defer Module Concepts
===================

Key Concepts:
1. Defer Basics
   - Defer keyword usage
   - Execution order
   - Stack-based deferral
   - Function completion handling

2. Important Features:
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) execution
   - Multiple defer statements
   - Defer in loops
   - Deferred function calls

3. Use Cases:
   - Resource cleanup
   - File handling
   - Connection closing
   - Lock releasing
   - Logging

4. Key Points:
   - Deferred calls execute in reverse order
   - Executes at function return
   - Arguments evaluated immediately
   - Used for cleanup operations

5. Best Practices:
   - Use defer for cleanup
   - Consider execution order
   - Be mindful of resource management
   - Understand evaluation timing

6. Examples Demonstrated:
   - Basic defer usage
   - Multiple defers
   - Defer in loops
   - Order of execution

This module covers Go's defer mechanism for delaying execution of function calls until the surrounding function returns.
