06Pointer Module Concepts
======================

Key Concepts:
1. Pointer Basics
   - Declaration of pointers
   - Getting memory addresses (&)
   - Dereferencing pointers (*)
   - Nil pointers

2. Important Operations:
   - & operator: Get address of variable
   - * operator: Dereference pointer
   - Pointer arithmetic
   - Modifying values through pointers

3. Key Points:
   - Zero value of pointer is nil
   - Pointers provide direct memory access
   - Used for passing by reference
   - Useful for modifying values across function boundaries

4. Use Cases:
   - When you need to modify original values
   - Avoiding large data copies
   - Sharing memory between functions
   - Performance optimization

5. Best Practices:
   - Check for nil pointers
   - Use pointers for large structs
   - Use pointers when modification is needed

This module demonstrates pointer usage in Go and shows how to work with memory addresses directly.
