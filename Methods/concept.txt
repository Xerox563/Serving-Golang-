Methods Module Concepts
=====================

Key Concepts:
1. Struct Methods
   - Method declaration syntax
   - Receiver types
   - Value receivers vs pointer receivers
   - Method sets

2. Struct Basics:
   - Struct definition
   - Field naming conventions
   - Exported vs unexported fields
   - Struct initialization

3. Method Features:
   - Method receivers
   - Method calling syntax
   - Value vs pointer methods
   - Method inheritance

4. Important Concepts:
   - Method vs Function differences
   - Struct field visibility
   - Method receiver behavior
   - Value copying in methods
   - Struct printing with %+v

5. Key Points:
   - Methods are functions with receivers
   - Value receivers create copies
   - Capitalization for export control
   - Struct field access in methods
   - Method naming conventions

6. Examples Demonstrated:
   - GetStatus method
   - NewMail method (value receiver limitations)
   - Struct field access
   - Pretty printing structs

This module demonstrates how to work with methods in Go, particularly in relation to structs.
